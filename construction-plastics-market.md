<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Construction Plastics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoplastics</li><li>Thermosetting Plastics</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The construction plastics market primarily includes two types: thermoplastics and thermosetting plastics. Thermoplastics, such as PVC, PE, and PP, are materials that can be repeatedly softened by heating and hardened by cooling, making them versatile for applications like piping, insulation, and cladding. In contrast, thermosetting plastics, such as epoxy and phenolic resins, undergo a chemical change when heated, becoming rigid and durable, ideal for applications requiring high strength and thermal stability, such as composite materials and structural components.</p></p>
